Write a function `averageMinMax` that takes an array of integers, and displays the minimum, the maximum, and the average of those integers.

Reminder: the average of a series of integers is the total sum of those integers divided by the number of integers. You will floor the result.

Here are a few test cases:


Test:   averageMinMax([-42, 0, 42])
Output:
```Min: -42
Max: 42
Average: 0
```

Test:   averageMinMax([30, 20, 100])
Output:
```Min: 20
Max: 100
Average: 50
```

Test:   averageMinMax([-23, -4, -12])
```Min: -23
Max: -4
Average: -13
```
