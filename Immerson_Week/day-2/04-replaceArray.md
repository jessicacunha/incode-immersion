Write a function `replaceArray` that takes an array of words and returns it after replacing all words that start with `h` or `H` by their uppercase version.

All other words will remain unchanged.


Here are a few test cases:

Test:   replaceArray(["banana", "suit", "hammer"])
Return:
```[ 'banana', 'suit', 'HAMMER' ]
```

Test:   replaceArray(["Hello", "there"])
Return:
```[ 'HELLO', 'there' ]
```

Test:   replaceArray(["Hey!", "hey..."])
Return:
```[ 'HEY!', 'HEY...' ]
```
