Write a function `matrixGen` that takes an height and a width as arguments. It will return a two-dimensional array where the value in the cell at row i and column j is i x j.


Here are a few test cases:

Test:   matrixGen(1,5)
Return:
```[ [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ] ]
```

Test:   matrixGen(5,4)
Return:
```[
  [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ],
  [ 2, 4, 6, 8 ],
  [ 3, 6, 9, 12 ],
  [ 4, 8, 12, 16 ],
  [ 5, 10, 15, 20 ]
]
```

Test:   matrixGen(3,6)
Return:
```[
  [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ],
  [ 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 ],
  [ 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 ]
]
```

Test:   matrixGen(0,0)
Return:
```[]
```
