Write a function `hasValueDepth` that takes a nested object and a value as arguments, and returns whether that value is found in the object.

The value must be found as a value, not as a key.


We will test with the following object:

```var obj = {
    "hello": "world",
    "goDeeper": {
        1961: "Barack Obama",
        1964: "Michelle Obama",
        1935: "Elvis Presley",
        1984: {
            "author": "George Orwell",
            "genre": "dystopia",
        }
    }
}
```

Here are a few test cases:

Test:   hasValueDepth(obj, "hello")
Return:
```false
```

Test:   hasValueDepth(obj, "Elvis Presley")
Return:
```true
```

Test:   hasValueDepth(obj, "author")
Return:
```false
```

Test:   hasValueDepth(obj, "dystopia")
Return:
```true
```
